## Overview

**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It provides:
- A complete and understandable description of the data in your API.
- The ability for clients to ask for exactly what they need.
- Powerful developer tools.

The [GraphQL Specification](https://spec.graphql.org/) is open source and governed by the [GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/).
