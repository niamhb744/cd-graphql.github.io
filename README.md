## Overview

**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It provides:

- a complete and understandable description of the data in your API,
- support for powerful developer tooling, and
- precise querying, which offers several benefits:
  - clients request only the data they need, improving efficiency;
  - new fields and features can be added without impacting existing clients; and
  - field-level usage can be tracked and monitored for insights and optimization.

The [GraphQL Specification](https://spec.graphql.org/) is open source and governed by the [GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/).
